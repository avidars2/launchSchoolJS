/** What is OOP?
 * 
 * Object oriented programming is a programming paradigm which involves
 * structure software into objects which interact with each other.
 * 
 * These objects have behaviors and state and allow for code to be structured
 * as a series of small parts which is useful in a large, complex codebase.
 */

/** Describe some advantages and disadvantages of OOP
 * 
 * Some advantages of OOP are that it allows for more readable, easier to reaon with
 * code. It reduces dependencies where instead of the code being a massive series of
 * dependencies, OOP done well leads to encapsulated objects which can function in isolation
 * 
 * It makes it so that expanding the program, making changes, reasoning is easier as
 * you can work with nouns like you would real life objects.
 * 
 * Behavior/state is contained/protected in individual objects so working on an object reduces
 * downstream effects.
 * 
 * Disadvantages:
 * OOP programs can be less efficient, use more memory and disk space. It can also be
 * larger than procedural code.

/** In your own words, what does encapsulation refer to in JavaScript?
 * It refers to creating objects with there own related properties and methods.
 * 
 * It is taking data and related behaviors and containing them into an object with properties
 * and methods.
 * 
 */

/** In JavaScript, how does encapsulation differ from encapsulation in most other OO languages?
 * 
 * This seems to have changed but apparently the difference was that encapsulation served the purpose
 * of both allowing for a public interface which other parts of a program could interact with without
 * amending the state and behavior of an object. However JavaScript originally did not have this capability
 * directly. But as of 2022, this has changed with the addition of 'private Classes'
