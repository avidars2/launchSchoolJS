    <h1>Hello, Internet!</h1>

    <div class="intro-text">
      <p>
        Welcome to my website! It's a work in progress as I learn <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong>
        from a <em>terrific</em> class I'm taking at <a href="www.launchschool.com">Launch School</a>. I'm learning a lot! Why don't you join me?
      </p>
      <p class="more-text">
        There's not a lot of material on this page as I'm playing around with HTML &amp; CSS. When I'm done,
        these last two paragraphs will take on a lighter color than the first - the "class" attribute on the
        two &lt;p&gt; tags and a bit of CSS will help accomplish that.
      </p>

      <p class="more-text" id="final-paragraph">
        This is the final paragraph. It also uses the &quot;class&quot; attribute as well as an &quot;id&quot; attribute.
        We'll use some CSS and the &quot;id&quot; attribute to underline the entire paragraph.
      </p>
